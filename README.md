Introduction
This portfolio showcases my analytical journey through a statistical modeling course, where I explored predictive modeling techniques using three distinct datasets: the Diamonds dataset from the ggplot2 package, the 2019 Parent and Family Involvement (PFI) dataset, and the Auto dataset from the ISLR package. Authored by Sandra Osei, this work demonstrates my ability to apply a range of statistical methods—including multiple regression, multinomial logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), polynomial regression, and ridge regression—to address real-world questions. Each analysis leverages the tidymodels framework in R for data preprocessing, model fitting, and performance evaluation, ensuring robust workflows with proper validation techniques like train-test splits and cross-validation. The Diamonds analysis predicts carat weights using physical and qualitative attributes, the PFI analysis examines factors influencing K-12 student grades, and the Auto analysis models car acceleration while addressing multicollinearity. Through these projects, I aim to highlight my proficiency in statistical modeling, data interpretation, and the application of insights to practical contexts, such as educational initiatives like GVSU’s K-12 Connect.
